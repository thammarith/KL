# Technical Stack & Requirements

This is a web application that allows users to split bills with their friends. The application will be a PWA (Progressive Web App) that can be installed on a user's device. The entire application runs client-side with no server requirements, making it free to host on GitHub Pages.

KL is an PWA app that works on all platforms and offline. There will be no remote server involved except Google's Gemini API for AI image processing.

No database unless it's necessary. If it's necessary, it'll be a local database like IndexedDB.

## Tech stack

This is required but feel free to extend:

1. PNPM
2. Vite
3. React 18+
4. TypeScript
5. Tailwind v4+
6. Progressive web app (PWA)

## CI/CD

Set up GitHub Action to publish this on GitHub Pages

## Security

Don't worry about encryption, data sensitivity because it's all done on client side.
