# Bill Scanner Implementation Plan

## Current Status: ✅ OPERATIONAL

**The bill scanning functionality is fully implemented and working!**

- **Phase 0:** ✅ Firebase Functions infrastructure deployed
- **Phase 1:** ✅ UI components and image processing complete
- **Phase 2:** ✅ Google Gemini API integration operational
- **Phase 3:** 🚀 Ready for final integration steps

Users can now capture or upload bill photos, which are automatically processed using Google Gemini API to create structured bill data.

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding bill scanning functionality to the KL app. Users will be able to capture or upload photos of bills, which will be processed using Google Gemini API to automatically create structured bill data.

## Key Requirements

1. **Image Capture/Upload**: Allow users to take or upload bill photos
2. **Local Storage**: Store compressed images in IndexedDB for verification (not as base64)
3. **Image Processing**: Send full-resolution images to Google Gemini for maximum accuracy
4. **Structured Output**: Extract bill data matching our internal schema
5. **Security**: Protect API keys using Firebase Functions backend
6. **Deployment**: Single command deployment process
7. **Translation Format**: Deprecate English fields, use parentheses format instead

## Architecture

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

- Image capture/upload UI in `index.tsx`
- Image compression for IndexedDB storage
- Full-resolution upload to backend
- Integration with existing bill creation flow

### Backend (Firebase Functions v2)

- Secure HTTP endpoint with authentication
- Google Gemini API integration
- Environment variable management for API keys
- Structured data extraction and formatting

### Storage

- **IndexedDB**: Compressed images for user verification
- **Memory**: Full-resolution images processed in-memory (not stored)

## Data Schema

### Google Gemini Response Schema

```typescript
const billExtractionSchema = {
	type: 'object',
	properties: {
		restaurant: {
			type: 'string',
			description:
				"Restaurant name with transliteration in parentheses, e.g., 'สุกี้ยากี้ (Suki Yaki)'",
		},
		items: {
			type: 'array',
			items: {
				type: 'object',
				properties: {
					name: {
						type: 'string',
						description:
							"Item name with translation in parentheses, e.g., 'ข้าวผัด (Fried Rice)'",
					},
					amount: {
						type: 'number',
						description: 'Price of the item',
					},
					quantity: {
						type: 'number',
						description: 'Quantity ordered',
						default: 1,
					},
				},
				required: ['name', 'amount'],
			},
		},
		adjustments: {
			type: 'array',
			items: {
				type: 'object',
				properties: {
					name: {
						type: 'string',
						description:
							"Adjustment name with translation, e.g., 'ภาษี (Tax)', 'ค่าบริการ (Service Charge)'",
					},
					amount: {
						type: 'number',
						description: 'Adjustment amount (positive or negative)',
					},
				},
				required: ['name', 'amount'],
			},
		},
		subTotal: {
			type: 'number',
			description: 'Subtotal before adjustments',
		},
		grandTotal: {
			type: 'number',
			description: 'Final total after all adjustments',
		},
		currency: {
			type: 'string',
			description: "Currency code (e.g., 'THB', 'USD')",
		},
		date: {
			type: 'string',
			description: 'Date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)',
			nullable: true,
		},
		time: {
			type: 'string',
			description: 'Time in HH:MM format',
			nullable: true,
		},
	},
	required: ['restaurant', 'items', 'subTotal', 'grandTotal', 'currency'],
};
```

### Prompt Engineering

```text
Extract structured data from this bill/receipt image:

1. Restaurant name: Include original text followed by phonetic transliteration (NOT translation) in parentheses
   Example: "สุกี้ยากี้ (Suki Yaki)"

2. Menu items: Include original name followed by English translation in parentheses
   Example: "ข้าวผัด (Fried Rice)"
   - If quantity > 1, note it separately
   - Extract the total price for each line item

3. Adjustments (tax, service charge, discounts):
   Example: "ภาษี (Tax)", "ค่าบริการ (Service Charge)"
   - Include both positive and negative adjustments

4. Extract subtotal (before adjustments) and grand total (final amount)

5. Identify currency code (THB, USD, etc.)

6. Extract date and time if visible

IMPORTANT:
- For restaurant names: Use TRANSLITERATION (how it sounds), not translation
- For menu items and adjustments: Use TRANSLATION (what it means)
- Always format as: "Original Text (English)"
```

    - Never expose in frontend code

2. **Authentication**
    - Require Firebase Auth
    - Validate user tokens

3. **Rate Limiting**
    - Implement per-user quotas
    - Monitor usage patterns
    - Protection against automated abuse

4. **Input Validation**
    - Check image sizes
    - Validate MIME types
    - Sanitize responses

## Deployment Configuration ✅ COMPLETED

The bill scanning functionality is fully deployed and operational:

- ✅ Firebase Functions deployed to `asia-southeast1` region
- ✅ `processBillv1` function operational with Google Gemini API integration
- ✅ Frontend built and deployed with complete bill scanning workflow
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured for production

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Deploy functions only
cd functions && pnpm build && firebase deploy --only functions

# Deploy frontend only
pnpm build && firebase deploy --only hosting

# Deploy everything
pnpm build && cd functions && pnpm build && cd .. && firebase deploy
```

## Cost Estimation

### Google Gemini API Pricing (as of 2024)

- **Gemini 2.0 Flash**: Most cost-effective for this use case
- **Input**: ~$0.075 per 1M tokens
- **Output**: ~$0.30 per 1M tokens
- **Image Input**: Calculated based on resolution

### Optimization Strategies

1. Use Gemini 2.0 Flash for cost efficiency
2. Compress images before sending (balance quality vs cost)
3. Cache common restaurant menus (future enhancement)
4. Implement user quotas if needed
